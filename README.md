ZF\Console: Console Tool Helper
===============================

zf-console provides functionality on top of `Zend\Console`, specifically:

- route creation
- route aggregation
- route matching
- error reporting
- command dispatch

Among other things, it provides built-in help reporting, and flexible argument
handling (per `Zend\Console\RouteMatcher`).
